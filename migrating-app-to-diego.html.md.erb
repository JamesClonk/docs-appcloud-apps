title: Migrating Apps to Diego
---

_This page assumes you are using cf CLI v6._

This topic contains instructions for migrating apps originally deployed on the DEA architecture to the newer Diego architecture.

1. Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CF CLI) to install the Diego-Enabler plugin.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community http://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/
	$ cf install-plugin Diego-Enabler -r CF-Community
	</pre>

2. Deploy your app to diego using the following commands.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf push â€”no-start YOUR-APP
	$ cf enable-diego YOUR-APP
	$ cf start YOUR-APP
	</pre>

3. Push your application to PCF with a new name and the route for your application. Do not use the name of the existing application.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf push NEW-APP -d MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN
	</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>The currently deployed application and the application you are pushing must be the same version. Otherwise, any static assets served from your application, like CSS and Javascript, will not be consistent across both apps. Now is not the time to upgrade your app.</p>

4. Confirm that NEW-APP runs properly.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf app NEW-APP
	</pre>

5. Run has-diego-enabled to confirm that the application is running on the Diego architecture.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf has-diego-enabled NEW-APP
	</pre>

6. Map the route for your application running on the DEA architecture to NEW-APP. This remapping creates a second route that splits your traffic between the DEA and Diego architectures.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf map-route NEW-APP MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN
	</pre>

7. Unmap the route from the application running on the DEA architecture. This action sends all of the traffic to the application that is running on Diego.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf unmap-route OLD-APP MY-DOMAIN.COM -n MY-SUBDOMAIN
	</pre>

8. Stop `OLD-APP` to route all traffic to `NEW-APP` and complete the blue-green migration.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf stop OLD-APP
	</pre>
Note: Verify that your application is still accessible and runs properly. If there is a problem with your app, do not complete this procedure. Instead, proceed to the Application Rollback procedure below.

9. Delete the old application.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf delete OLD-APP
	</pre>
